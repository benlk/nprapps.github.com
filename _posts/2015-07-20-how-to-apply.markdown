We want to see your best work.

Here’s how.

(In case you missed it, [applications are currently open for our fall internships](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/07/16/fall-internships.html).)

## Cover letters

All candidates must submit a cover letter. Your cover letter should be a statement of purpose. We’re interested in _what_ you’re passionate about and _why_ you’re passionate about it.
(Most cover letters tell us _that_ you are hardworking, passionate and talented, etc. And that you love NPR. We don’t need you to tell us that.) 

* Tell us what you care about and work on.
* Tell us why you are passionate about your work.
* Tell us why this opportunity will help you reach your potential.
* Tell us how you will contribute to our team. 

## Other expectations

* Photo internships candidates must have a portfolio.
* Programming/design candidates with either projects on Github or a personal site are strongly preferred.

## Selection process

After you submit a resume and cover letter, our selection committee will read through all the applications. We’ll reduce the list to approximately 8-10 candidates by eliminating applications that don’t have a cover letter and resume or who clearly aren’t a good fit for the team. 

If you’re one of these candidates, two or three folks from the Visuals team will conduct a 30 minute Skype interview with you. You’ll get an email before your interview with outline of the questions you’ll be asked in the interview and also given the opportunity to ask any questions beforehand. The questions may vary a bit from interview to interview based on your professional experience, but we will be as consistent as possible. 

Then we’ll call references and conduct some follow-up via email, possibly asking one or two more substantial, interview-style questions. Email communication is crucial in our workplace, and gives us an opportunity to see how you communicate in writing. We expect that answers are prompt, succinct, and clear.

We’ll follow up with all of our finalists with some constructive criticism about their application and interview.

## Why we’re doing this

Everyone on the Visuals team wants to increase the diversity of our field. So we’re trying something new to reduce the effects of privilege in the job application process for our next photo and applications intern hirings. 

Applicants with strong cover letters and good interview skills naturally tend to do well in this process. Often, those skills are a result of coaching and support. To help candidates without those resources, we’re being more transparent about our process and expectations.

We’re certain that we’re missing out on candidates with great talent and potential who don’t have that kind of support in their lives. We think knowing our cover letter expectations and interview questions ahead of time will help level the playing field, keep our personal bias out of the interview process, and allow better comparisons between candidates. 

## Apply for this fall!
