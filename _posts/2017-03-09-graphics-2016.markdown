## School Funding

One of our biggest data-wrangling efforts this year was the [School Money series](http://www.npr.org/series/473636949/schoolmoney), a partnership between NPR Ed and Education Week that examined how districts around the nation pay for their schools. Since we were working with data from more than 13,000 school districts, we needed to present the data in ways that could show nationwide patterns as well as granular views, focused on a user's local school district.

![Map of school district spending per student](/img/posts/gfx16-school-funding.png)

We created a national map of each district's spending that could search for and zoom to individual districts, paired with a histogram to show the distribution of spending across the U.S. We were able to re-use this base map to create small, static state maps. For a story on state disparities in funding, we plotted each school district's spending in a way that could show both disparity and distribution across all 50 states.

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** For the map, we used R to parse and analyze data from Education Week, which we mapped using [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/). We used Maxmind's [GeoIP2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo) service to auto-locate users' home states. Our R script included an export of school districts bucketed by spending, which formed the basis of our histogram drawn in D3 ([code](https://github.com/nprapps/graphics-archive/blob/master/2016/04/school-funding-map-20160408/)). The dot plot, meanwhile, was drawn in R and then styled in Adobe Illustrator.

## Election Results: Maps And Beyond

People know the standard geographic map and how to find themselves in it, but sometimes that's not the best way to highlight a trend or represent a particular dataset. We continued experimenting with alternatives to the usual geographic map, from our [tile grid map template](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/05/11/hex-tile-maps.html) (introduced in 2015) to cartograms to things that were not maps at all.

### The County Map

A few days after the election, we took a look at [geographic distribution of the vote](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/15/502032052/lots-of-people-voted-for-obama-and-trump-heres-where-in-3-charts). County-level results maps (versus state-level) can offer a more granular view of political divisions and similarities within states and regions. For added context, we made a similar map of the results from 2012, using the same scale. Animating between the two, the reader can see where support deepened or lessened for a given party.

<small>From: [The Counties That Flipped From Obama To Trump, In 3 Charts](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/15/502032052/lots-of-people-voted-for-obama-and-trump-heres-where-in-3-charts) (Nov. 15, 2016)</small>

    var el = document.getElementById('responsive-embed-elex-map-county-margins-20161110');
    var pymParent = new pym.Parent(el.id, '//apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/elex-map-county-margins-20161110/child.html', {});
</script>

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** We downloaded results data from the AP elections API (paid subscription required) using [Elex](http://elex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and analyzed the results in Microsoft Excel. We made the county maps using D3 and then used screenshots for the final graphics.

This kind of results map isn't perfect, though: While it can convey explicitly geographic differences, it doesn't say anything about the number and distribution of votes cast. Major population centers are flattened out.

### The Electoral Cartogram

The presidency is decided by the Electoral College result: Who wins each state, weighted by that state's representation in Congress. On election night, then, while county results can give a clue to how the state will tilt, the key thing to watch is who wins each state. A standard state map, while familiar, is inappropriate for this purpose: Geographic size has no relationship to a state's electoral value. (For example, Montana is huge, dwarfing, say, Massachusetts. But Massachusetts is more populous, and, with 11 electoral votes to Montana's 3, should have more visual presence on the screen.) For this reason, we created an [electoral cartogram](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/09/500716650/donald-trump-clinches-the-presidency-in-major-upset). Each state is represented as a square roughly in its expected geographic location, but sized according to its electoral heft.

</script>

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** We periodically downloaded results data from the AP elections API (paid subscription required) using [Elex](http://elex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and reprocessed it into a JSON file. The map was written in JavaScript, with D3. Source on Github: [Results processor](https://github.com/nprapps/elections16-general/), [Graphics](https://github.com/nprapps/elections16graphics)

During primary season, we took a similar approach in presenting [delegate results](http://www.npr.org/2016/03/02/468641509/elections-2016-democratic-and-republican-delegate-tracker). Each state was worth a different number of delegates (corresponding roughly to its population). As an added wrinkle, most states were not winner-take-all: Multiple candidates could win delegates in a state, depending on party rules and their share of the vote. To address this, we made a cartogram for each major candidate (in addition to a bar chart with overall totals and a data table with state-by-state results).

<small>From: [Elections 2016: Democratic And Republican Delegate Tracker](http://www.npr.org/2016/03/02/468641509/elections-2016-democratic-and-republican-delegate-tracker) (March 2, 2016)</small>

![Map of Republican delegate results](/img/posts/gfx16-delegates.png)


### Not A Map

Because a candidate's success in a given county can give clues to how that candidate will perform state-wide, we judged that it was important to include live county-level results with our election night coverage. However, since location alone isn't the most relevant factor to consider about each county, we decided to display [county results in tabular form](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/08/501063960/arizona-2016-presidential-and-state-election-results), allowing users to compare (and sort) counties by additional demographic, economic and political factors.

We also displayed live presidential, Senate, House and ballot measure results in the form of a ["big board,"](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/08/499287941/2016-senate-race-election-results) with elections sorted by poll closing time so that users could follow along throughout the night.

![Tabular results](/img/posts/gfx16-tabular-results.png)

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** Before the election, we downloaded county-level data from the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. On election night, we periodically downloaded results data from the AP elections API (paid subscription required) using [Elex](http://elex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and reprocessed it into a JSON file. The county results page checked for updated data every 10 seconds and refreshed the information on the page as necessary. Source on Github: [Results processor](https://github.com/nprapps/elections16-general/), [Graphics](https://github.com/nprapps/elections16graphics)

In a post-election analysis, we evaluated county results based on a characteristic _other_ than geography: [the urban-rural divide](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/14/501737150/rural-voters-played-a-big-part-in-helping-trump-defeat-clinton).

<small>From: [Rural Voters Played A Big Part In Helping Trump Defeat Clinton](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/14/501737150/rural-voters-played-a-big-part-in-helping-trump-defeat-clinton) (Nov. 14, 2016)</small>

</script>

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** We downloaded results data from the AP elections API (paid subscription required) using [Elex](http://elex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We wrote a Python script to categorize counties and their results according to the [USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/). And then we rendered our findings with a stacked bar chart using D3 ([code](https://github.com/nprapps/graphics-archive/tree/master/2016/11/elex-rural-2016-20161110)).

## Illustration Takes Center Stage

We worked closely with [LA Johnson](https://twitter.com/thelajohnson),
an illustrator and visual editor with NPR Ed, to create several projects
that showcased illustration as the primary storytelling device.

### A Great Teacher, Illustrated

LA reported and illustrated [this comic on an outstanding art teacher](http://www.npr.org/2016/03/09/469097318/a-great-teacher-illustrated) for NPR Ed's 50 Great Teachers series. To make it fully responsive, we designed the text to be readable at all screen sizes and even swapped out a few panels of the comic with versions specially sized for different breakpoints.

![A Great Teacher, Illustrated](/img/posts/gfx16-art-teacher.jpg)

### A Silent Epidemic

NPR's Education team took an in-depth look at how public schools handle student mental health issues and how many schools struggle to support students, parents, teachers and staff. We worked with them on a piece that would convey the enormity of the challenge and strategies experts have identified to address it.

This project called out for a sequential visual explanation of the issue, but we didn't have a large data set or photography to aid in the storytelling. We went through several iterations of storyboards to lay out the problem of mental health care in schools and the proposed solutions. LA's artwork solidified the visual style of the piece and brought human faces to a sensitive subject. Her illustrations even formed the basis for our data visualizations, which used silhouettes of her characters as icons.

![Screenshots from A Silent Epidemic](/img/posts/gfx16-mental-health.png)

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** We used our [app template](https://github.com/nprapps/app-template) and previous work done for our [Look At This](https://github.com/nprapps/lookatthis) experimental storytelling series as the backbone for our sequential format. The visualizations are SVG icons rendered and animated with D3. [Source on GitHub →](https://github.com/nprapps/mental-health)

## The Driving Life And Death Of Philando Castile

[Philando Castile](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/15/485835272/the-driving-life-and-death-of-philando-castile) was a black man shot and killed during a traffic stop in the summer of 2016. NPR reporters looked through years of court documents to build a timeline of his interactions with the law during his life -- "a seemingly endless cycle of traffic stops, fines, court appearances, late fees, revocations and reinstatements" -- and look at broader issues around poverty, race and policing.

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** The data for the timeline and graphic were collected and analyzed using Google Spreadsheets. The graphic was rendered using D3. [Source on GitHub →](https://github.com/nprapps/graphics-archive/tree/master/2016/07/timeline-castile-overview-20160612)

## Early Voting

In the months before the election, we worked with NPR's Washington Desk on an [early voting primer](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/23/491999689/a-complete-guide-to-early-and-absentee-voting) that offered both practical information for voters and context about how it works and how to interpret voting data. Design-wise, the voter guide drew from a [similar project](http://apps.npr.org/early-voting-2012/) from 2012. This version was built to be embedded in a story page, and we added localization: The lookup defaults to the user's home state (as best we can detect it).

[![Early voting](/img/posts/gfx16-early-voting.png)](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/23/491999689/a-complete-guide-to-early-and-absentee-voting)

{: .how}
**How We Made This:** We researched voting information for each state and logged everything in a Google Spreadsheet. The maps ([code](https://github.com/nprapps/graphics-archive/tree/master/2016/09/early-voting-states-20160831)) were built using the [state grid map template](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics/tree/master/graphic_templates/state_grid_map) in our dailygraphics rig. For the state lookup ([code](https://github.com/nprapps/graphics-archive/tree/master/2016/09/early-voting-calendar-20160831)), we used Maxmind's [GeoIP2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo) service to auto-locate users' home states.
