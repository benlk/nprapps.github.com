Hey!

Are you a student?

Do you design? Develop? Love the web?

...or...

Do you make pictures? Want to learn to be a great photo editor?

If so, we'd very much like to hear from you. You'll spend the spring working on the visuals team here at NPR's headquarters in Washington, DC. We're a small group of photographers, videographers, photo editors, developers, designers and reporters in the NPR newsroom who work on visual stuff for [npr.org]. Our work varies widely, [check it out here].
