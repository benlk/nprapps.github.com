Are you data-curious, internet savvy, and interested in journalism? Do you draw, design, or write code? We are looking for you.

We've had journalists who are learning to code, programmers who are learning about journalism, designers who love data graphics, designers who love UX, reporters who love data, and illustrators who make beautiful things.

Does this sound like you? Please join our team! It isn't always easy, but it is very rewarding. You'll learn a ton and you'll have a lot of fun.

The paid internship runs from September 11, 2017 to December 8, 2017. **Applications are due Sunday, July 16, 2017 at 11:59pm eastern**.
